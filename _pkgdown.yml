  desc: In Fay et al. (2025) *Vaccine Efficacy Estimands for Individual Randomized Field Trials*, the $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ approach is used. In this approach which utilizes the "Weibull-Weibull-Positive Stable" model, the population (marginal) Weibull is estimated, and then $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ is applied to those estimates to render the individual-level (conditional) Weibull. This code recreates Figure 6 in that paper.
