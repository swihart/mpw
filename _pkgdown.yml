  desc: The $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ approach used in Fay MP et al.
  In this approach which utilizes the "Weibull-Weibull-Positive Stable" model,
  the population (marginal) Weibull is estimated, and
  then $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ is applied to those estimates
  to render the individual-level (conditional) Weibull.
