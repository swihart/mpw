### $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ approaches

(*In progress*) In Fay et al. (2026) *Vaccine Efficacy Estimands for
Individual Randomized Field Trials*, the $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ approach is
used. In this approach which utilizes the “Weibull-Weibull-Positive
Stable” model, the population (marginal) Weibull is estimated, and then
$\frac{1}{\alpha}$ is applied to those estimates to render the
individual-level (conditional) Weibull. This code recreates Figure 6 in
that paper.

### Exploratory approaches

These articles describe how to explore underlying heterogeneity. They
require specifying a value for the heterogeneity parameter `h_parm`.

### Inferential approaches

These articles show how to get confidence interval on underlying
heterogeneity (in progress).
